# Ecosystem Stimulation :deciduous_tree:

**The project "Ecosystem Stimulation" inspired by some game developers on Youtube give a small view of my own simple forest.**


**The main library used in my Javascript project is [three.js](https://threejs.org/)**

*Additional libraries support my development: [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)*

__P.S__: This is my first 3D Javascript project, so any bugs or mistakes please feel free to make pull requests to my project. I love your contributions.
